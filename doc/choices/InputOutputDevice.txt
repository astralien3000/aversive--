Device -- Module

cf schema.

We chose to implement a class IODevice which 
inherits from InputDevice and Output and which dupplicates
the code of OutputDevice. 

An other solution would have been to create
a diamond structure to not dupplicate the code.
But the size in the RAM would be increased :
virtual inheritance needs pointer in the child class.
