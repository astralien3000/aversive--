\page "Create a project" Create a project

To create a new project, you need to copy the minimal main.cpp and Makefile files into your project's directory from /doc/example/new_project (you can see these files below too).

These files are commented so read the comments for more details.

main.cpp:
\include new_project/main.cpp

Makefile:
\include new_project/Makefile
